The 'Fare' column shows a large standard deviation in both datasets (49.69 in the train and 55.90 in the test dataset, with a maximum fare of 512.33, which is an outlier compared to the median of 0, suggesting a few passengers had a large number of parents/children.\n5.

The 'Age' column has a relatively high standard deviation in both datasets, implying a wide variation in passenger ages.\n7. The 'Fare' column exhibits a large standard deviation compared to the mean, indicating a few passengers paid much more than the average, likely due to first-class tickets or special conditions, with the maximum fare being the same in both datasets.\n8.

There is a highly significant relationship between 'Survived' and 'Pclass', with a chi-squared statistic of 102.89, a p-value of 4.55e-23, and 2 degrees of freedom, indicating that passenger class is strongly associated with survival.\n2. The relationship between 'Survived' and 'Sex' is extremely significant, as evidenced by a chi-squared statistic of 260.72, a p-value of 1.20e-58, and 1 degree of freedom, suggesting that gender plays a crucial role in survival rates.\n3. The chi-squared test between 'Survived' and 'AgeGroup' shows a significant association with a statistic of 19.53, a p-value of 0.0067, and 7 degrees of freedom, implying that age group has a notable impact on survival, although less so than 'Sex'.\n4. The most significant factor affecting survival is 'Sex', with a chi-squared statistic of 260.72, a p-value of 1.20e-58, and 1 degree of freedom, highlighting that gender is the most influential factor among the three variables considered, with females having a higher likelihood of survival compared to males.\n5. The survival rate varies significantly across different age groups, with a chi-squared statistic of 19.53, a p-value of 0.0067, and 7 degrees of freedom, indicating that age also plays a role in survival, but to a lesser extent than 'Sex'.",
