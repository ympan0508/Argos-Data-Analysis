You could add a check to see if the columns exist before proceeding to group by them.\n\n3. **Data Type Validation**: It's also a good idea to validate the data types of 'BALANCE', 'PURCHASES', 'CREDIT_LIMIT' to ensure they are numeric before performing aggregation.\n\n4. **Robust Error Handling**: Consider adding try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully rather than exiting with an error.\n\nOnce these fixes are implemented, try running the script again.

However, there are critical issues with visibility and clarity:\n\n1. **Overlapping Elements**: The boxplots for 'PURCHASES' and 'CREDIT_LIMIT' have overlapping elements that are difficult to distinguish. This could be due to the scale of the data. Consider using a logarithmic scale for the y-axis, especially for 'PURCHASES' which has large values.\n\n2. **Labels**: Ensure that the axis labels and titles are readable, possibly increasing the font size for clarity.\n\n3. **Outliers Visualization**: While outliers are indicated, they can clutter the visualization. Consider using a different method to visualize outliers or focusing on the main data points.\n\n4. **Color Consistency**: The color scheme across the plots is inconsistent. Using a uniform color palette across all boxplots will enhance the visual appeal and coherence.\n\nBy addressing these points, the visualization can be made clearer and more informative.",

These tenures also exhibit more pronounced outliers compared to other tenures.\n  \n2. **PURCHASES Variation**: The logarithmic scale boxplot for 'PURCHASES' indicates an increase in purchase values with longer tenures (especially noticeable in tenure 12), suggesting that longer tenured customers tend to have significantly higher purchase amounts.\n\n3. **CREDIT_LIMIT Consistency**: The 'CREDIT_LIMIT' boxplot indicates that most tenures have similar central tendencies (median values), but there are notable outliers, particularly in tenure 12, which may imply elevated credit limits for some customers.\n\n4. **Outlier Presence**: All three boxplots exhibit outliers, which could warrant further investigation to determine whether these represent genuinely high values or data entry errors. The outlier presence tends to increase with longer tenures in all three metrics examined.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: Collectively, these findings suggest that as tenure increases, both 'BALANCE' and 'PURCHASES' also tend to increase, indicating a potential correlation between customer loyalty (tenure) and financial activity, while 'CREDIT_LIMIT' remains relatively stable but includes some high-value outliers.",
